## What is computational thinking 
Computational thinking is about how to solve a problem by first understanding
the problem, breaking it down into small parts, solving each part, 
and then pulling all solutions together to form a complete solution to the 
problem. This skill is important to have to become a successful programmer 
and in other to tackle problems of clients and in the world at large.

## Terminologies
- Code block : everything that is indented after a conditional statement of
within a function
expensive function: function that takes up too much memory or time when it runs.
- argument: a value passed to a function when calling it, which the function uses as input.

- parameter: a variable in a function definition that receives an argument when the function is called.

- return value: the output that a function gives back when it finishes executing.

- variable scope: the part of the program where a variable can be accessed (e.g., global, local).

- immutable: an object whose value cannot be changed after it is created (e.g., strings in Python).

- mutable: an object whose value can be changed after it is created (e.g., lists in Python).

- - syntax error: a mistake in the code that violates the language rules and prevents it from running.

- runtime error: an error that occurs while the program is running, often due to invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

- logical error: a bug where the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.

- loop: a control structure that repeats a block of code multiple times (e.g., for, while).

- recursion: a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem.

- iteration: the process of repeating a set of instructions, typically over items in a sequence.

- algorithm: a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.

- data structure: a way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently (e.g., list, set, dictionary, tree).

- debugging: the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in code.

- exception: an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program, usually due to an error, and can be caught or handled.

- abstraction: hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts to reduce complexity.

- encapsulation: bundling data and functions that operate on that data within one unit (often a class), restricting access from outside.

- inheritance: a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class.

- polymorphism: the ability to use a shared interface to represent different data types or behaviors.

- API (Application Programming Interface): a set of rules and tools that allows one software system to communicate with another.

- library: a collection of pre-written code and functions that you can use in your own programs to save time and effort.

- framework: a larger structure or platform for building applications that provides pre-defined patterns and tools.

- compilation: the process of converting source code into machine code or intermediate code before it is executed.

- interpreter: a program that runs code line by line, rather than compiling it first.

## Writing clean code

- Not all code that works is efficient code. This is why code should always be reviewed in order to come up with better ways of improving efficiency.
- Wrapping parenthesis around a if statement condition when its too long to make it readable is a good practice in Python

## Writing efficient code
Knowing when to use recursion or iteration is an important skill in writing efficient code.

## debugging your code
Using the terminal to log the values of variables at every point in time to iterated through your code is a great technique for keeping track of your code


## Documenting your code
Documenting your code is a way to a make sure that you get a head start in
understanding your code for the next time you or anyone else revisits it.
