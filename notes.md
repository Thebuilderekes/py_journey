## What is computational thinking 
Computational thinking is about how to solve a problem by first understanding
the problem, breaking it down into small parts, solving each part, 
and then pulling all solutions together to form a complete solution to the 
problem. This skill is important to have to become a successful programmer 
and in other to tackle problems of clients and in the world at large.

## Terminologies
Code block : everything that is indented after a conditional statement of
within a function 


## Writing clean code
- Not all code that works is efficient code. This is why Code should always be reviewed in order to come up with better ways of improving efficiency.
- Wrapping parenthesis around a if statement condition when its too long to make it readable is a good practice in Python


## Documenting your code
Documenting your code is a way to a make sure that you get a head start in
understanding you code for the next time you revisit it.
