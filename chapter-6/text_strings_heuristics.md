## strings

We use triple quotes in python to enter long strings

### Properties of strings

- They are iterable
- Unlike lists, strings are **immutable** meaning that even ass they are iterable like lists, you cannot have items added into them as you have in lists.
- They come with inbuilt functions that can be used on them.
