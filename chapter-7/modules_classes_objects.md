Python creates a `__name__` variable and set its value to string `__main__` whenever a program is being ran as a main program.

A popular convention for checking if a program is the main program is to use the code below

`if __name__ = '__main__':
  // run the code within the if block`

## Objects

Objects are a way to bundle state(attributes) and behavior(method) together. There needs to be a way where different parts of the program can interact with each other and objects are the most compact way to achieve this.

## Classes

A class tells you what an object knows(state) and what an object can do(method). It is the blueprint for constructing objects.
