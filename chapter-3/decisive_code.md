## notes 
- 4 tab spaces is the convention for python.
- It helps to print as you go along to keep track of the state of variables.

- Logical operators are short-circuit Python

For example:
```
name = true
age = false

meassage = "eligible" if age and name else message = "short circuit because age is false"
```
